# Misra-Gries-Frequent-Patterns

I learned the Misra-Gries algorithm in the course SDSC 3001 (Big Data: The Arts and Science of Scaling) taught by Dr.Yu Yang at CityU. In the third assignment, we were asked to implement the algorithm to mine top-k most frequent patterns. The assignment was well structured and first we were asked to mathematically prove the correctness of our algorithm followed by the implementation.
